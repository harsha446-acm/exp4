Sakshi this is how the origin architecture is Egypt time so as I said a competition graph is debited to formalise the structure of setup quotation Infosys and parameters to outputs and laws we can unfold a recursive or recommended competition into a computational graph that has a repetitive success and unfolding this graph results in a sharing of parameters kalas the return same thing as CNN and this is you see this is your input long with the input you will babe the parameters are having the parameters and the both the input and at the stage you are taking the input zero you are going to get one and in next for this one will be given as input to the next one and you get 2 and this is how we represent basically this is how we represent SOSO free depends on tests of 2S of 2 depends on South of One South of one depends on SF zero this is the dependency that's why it is recurrent do you remember in algorithms recurrence relations this is of basically when they reach a dependency like this you see your tea is common do you see your Theta is common your input is changing the output of one becomes the input for the next one so that is exactly this thanks so this is exactly this is the rnl architecture it is fine right but it is having its own drawback so this is how we represent basically this is the representation so basically a function with maps one input for the next and so okay busy switch you have to work visa so high is called the hidden state basically hidden state in so from the input this is the first scene continuation table as spoke in Telugu second word 3rd word checks but you see they from bhagwad is having dependency on last word alumin AP ASP fluently in Telugu that means there is a language and there is a living place these 2 there is a dependency that dependence cannot be carried in this what is called the long term dependency sad permit dependent means immediately depending what it carries because you are passing the output of one becomes input to the next one but that long term dependency is not carried show a 10th board having dependency on Deepak Kumar and the dependence will not be carried forward because when it reaches that place all the vectors are going to be changed KA problem with the neuronal that is what second one is is single or nan CBC age normal Adnan only carries the dependency in One Direction what about the reverse direct you see it is checking whether there is a dependency in the previous part or not what about if bhagwati driving dependency on the last word or some other word UC custody driving dependency on thought what is having depending on second word as well as 4th word what is happening just it is going to check the dependency in the previous word but it is not picking dependency on the password show to carry barbad that involving bidirectional that means you can proceed your input from the beginning and you can process your input from the end also both direction you can do it so you can carry for both both dependencies that is the bidirectional RNA bidirectional you can carry password at the beginning at the end so when you use this so when it comes to second word it takes care the first word as well as the 3rd word both will be taken care so that is made electional this is like in picture recognition the correct interpretation of the current sound may depend on next few phones because of the articulation and the next few words because of linguistic dependencies where you get the bidirectional ordinance you can combine to forward and backward and this is how it looks like you see there is a H and there is a g so he man in the forward direction d is in the backward direction and both you are combining at this you see whatever the H you get here and whatever the g you get here both your combining yes that is the bidirectional that is the bidirectional or then but even though it can it takes care of both forward and backward he doesn't do you activate results tapabrata said it cannot carry forward the long term dependencies only short term that is previous and next only it can carry but if there are 5 what's away it cannot and this is is it fine I said this is so you can see the man who ate my pizza as purple hair that means there is a dependency on hair and man so that dependency cannot be carried forward in this okay is it fine so longer time dependency to handle this long term dependency alphabet 2 algorithms basically these are the 2 algorithms who use generally one is called ldm database is called gnu is it fine is the Indian is fine he is not related hit read Indian similarly I can speak French show there is a dependency that dependence cannot be carried see and for MBA with lesbea basically lcm uses 3 gates it uses 3 gates so I'll show you so this is the problem of the long term dependencies taxi the clouds are in the sky dependence taxi but when it comes to this yeah saying Hyderabad pin paanch I speak fluent French and this is the smart city PC us this nagori ketaki play narayana ke peeche we take the input and we are going to apply manipulation the magic place in just you are going to apply the dot product the input and the weights and
